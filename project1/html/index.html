            <p style="margin-left:3%; margin-top:4%;">This summer I interned at Upside Foods as a Molecular Screening Intern. Upside Foods is the first FDA and USDA approved cultivated meat company, and I was assigned to helping optimize the cell lines currently being developed as part of the R&D process. This meant that I mainly worked with cell culture and automation, working on optimizing automative efficiency and capacity. Within automation, I worked on a variety of liquid handlers, scripting in C#, JavaScript, and React. In order to facilitate and test the updated processes, this meant passaging suspension and adhesion cells, and imaging for several different flourescent markers at once. Lastly, I brought it together with datascience, learning R and improving my visualizations to both scientific and nonscientific audiences of varying project related knowledge. Overall, I learned a lot of relevant information supporting an environmentally sustainable and animal conscious organization in the process of shifting the paradigm on how we view our food!</p>

                Current copresident of the TMSCA, organizing the first TMSCA conference at UC Berkeley since 2018 and raising 6k of funding, triple any previous conference, and bringing in speakers from around the Bay Area, including UCB, UCSF, Stanford, and CIRM. As well, I facilitated partnerships with other student orgs, university spaces, and external corporations, with the end goal of educating UC Berkeley and the surrounding Bay Area high schools about stem cells and translational medicine.

                This website is dedicated to short scripts for help with lab calculations or coursework. This scripting website has Python integrated into Java using Pyscript, which allows me and my peers to write code in python, integrate it into the website as a small icon, and then cleanly outputting results.
